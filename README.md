## Deca Language Compiler Project

This project, undertaken over the course of one month at university, involved a team of four members, including myself. Together, we developed a compiler for the Deca language using Java.
Overview

The project was structured into three main phases: lexical and syntactical development, followed by contextual development, where we decorated the abstract syntax tree, and finally, code generation, responsible for producing executable files in Assembly.
Technical Details

Lexical and Syntactical Development: This part focused on building the lexical analyzer and parser for the Deca language.

Contextual Development: In this part, we worked on enhancing the abstract syntax tree with contextual information.

Code Generation:  Involved generating executable files in Assembly language.

## Management Approach

We adopted the agile methodology throughout the project, organizing our work into sprints lasting one week each. At the conclusion of each sprint, we delivered a tangible output.
